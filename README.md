## Introduction ##
This application allows users to input their own tasks for the working day (9-5). The application updates in real time by showing that a task is being done currently by highlighting red, showing a past task in grey, and future tasks in green.

## Technologies ##
The application was designed through the use of HTML, CSS and made functional through the use of Javascript. Javascript was the primary source in this project as all the HTML elements you see on the page were developed through jQuery and Javascript.

Not only is the application responsive and easy to use, it will also store all of your data locally. This means you will not have to keep the browser open worry  about losing data as it will stay there until you choose to delete it.
